                  . Beauty is, and always will be, in the “eye of the beholder.”
                  Your decision about the beauty or lack of beauty in a
                  particular work of art is instinctive and natural. In fact,
                  you probably won’t even have to make that decision; you’ll
                  just either be captivated by a piece of art or you won’t.
                  Design is a great way to make a living. It can be fulfilling,
                  helpful, and your work can have an impact on people and
                  culture. This is worth remembering when you are receiving
                  awards”
