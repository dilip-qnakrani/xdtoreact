            These days, the metaverse is not just a name for a fictional
            universe. In fact, it’s already here, and we’re all exploring it.
            Through augmented reality shopping, virtual travel in 3D, in-game
            live concerts, and immersive company websites – brands can now
            create hyper-realistic digital worlds that are changing the way we
            all interact with online content. What is the metaverse?
          </p>
          <p>
            The metaverse is a future where a new dimension of digital
            experiences will be available: virtual, immersive spaces connected
            by computers and populated by people. We believe that businesses
            need to prepare for this new world now to not miss out on the many
            opportunities it will provide for business, including customer
            experiences that are fruitful ground for personal experiences and
            boundless commerce. It’s time to get ready for its possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re building an open, accessible, and safe metaverse, and we
            invite you to take the leap beyond reality into a brand new world.
            Even if you never fully enter the metaverse, you can expect that it
            will change how you do business. The 3D tools that exist today will
            be a foundation for tomorrow’s immersive experiences, and companies
            are already using them to gain big efficiencies in their current
            operations.

            are asked to submit designs for a virtual college space “indoors”,
            as well as “outdoors”. As it would be a virtual environment, the

            useful to the concept design.
